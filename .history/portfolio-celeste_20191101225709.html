                        <li><p>Before Epicodus I was originally in the management and cosmetology field for almost 8 years. I then went back to school to finish my degree in business management at Marylhurst University. After working in the service industry for so long it was nice to finally be able to have an office job. But even after doing office work I still did not feel challenged or stimulated at my current job, and this is why I have chosen the path of web development. I took some web development classes in college back when facebook was just coming out, and web design was much different especially css.  The way it is now it so much easier, as far as reading and inputting code. </p></li>

                       <li><p>When not working full-time and doing school I enjoy many fun outdoor activities. I have recently moved to Central Oregon, from Portland and have discovered many new hobbies in my new town.  I enjoy going up to Mt. Bachelor and Mt. Hood to snowboard and hike. I like disc golf during the summer and kayaking at Paulina Lake. When not doing outdoor activities, I travel which is my number one passion. I really enjoy learning history and culture from new and exciting places. My favorite country, and a place I dream of living one day is France. </p></li>
